This is a thin layer on top of [`aiohttp`](https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/) to perform multiple HTTP requests in parallel â€“ without writing boilerplate code or worrying about `async` functions.

Install the latest stable version from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/multirequests):

```
pip install multirequests
```

## Usage

Pass an iterable of dictionaries with at least a value for `url` and get a generator with the responses:

```python
>>> import multirequests
>>> resources = [
...     {"url": "https://httpbin.org/get"},
...     {"url": "https://httpbin.org/get", "params": {"foo": "bar"}},
...     {"url": "invalid"},
... ]
>>> responses = multirequests.get(resources, batch_size=2)
>>> responses
<generator object get at 0x7fc2a9aae420>
>>> for resource, response in zip(resources, responses):
...     print(resource, "status code:", response["status"])
...
{'url': 'https://httpbin.org/get'} status code: 200
{'url': 'https://httpbin.org/get', 'params': {'foo': 'bar'}} status code: 200
{'url': 'invalid'} status code: 0
```

The keyword argument `batch_size` defines the number of requests to perform in parallel (don't be too greedy).

There is also a convenience function for POST requests:

```python
>>> resources = [
...     {"url": "https://httpbin.org/post"},
...     {"url": "https://httpbin.org/post", "json": {"foo": "bar"}},
...     {"url": "invalid"},
... ]
>>> responses = multirequests.get(resources)
```

You can even mix HTTP methods in the list of resources (but have to specify the method for each resource):

```python
>>> resources = [
...     {"method": "GET", "url": "https://httpbin.org/get"},
...     {"method": "GET", "url": "https://httpbin.org/get", "params": {"foo": "bar"}},
...     {"method": "POST", "url": "https://httpbin.org/post"},
...     {"method": "POST", "url": "https://httpbin.org/post", "json": {"foo": "bar"}},
...     {"method": "GET", "url": "invalid"},
... ]
>>> responses = multirequests.request(resources)
```
